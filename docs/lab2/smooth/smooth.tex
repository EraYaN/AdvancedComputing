\chapter{Smoothing}

\section{Kernel Implementation}
The kernel for the smoothing algorithm is similar to the approach described in \cref{sec:rgb2gray}.
A good approach to speed up this kernel would be to use the NVIDIA NPP library.
NVIDIA NPP is a library of functions for performing CUDA accelerated processing and it has special functionality for image filters.
However, implementing these library functions is beyond the scope of this report.
