\section{Task 1}
%TODO OpenCL Test Data Size. DP and SP.
As shown in \cref{fig:opencl-data-size-sweep}, for small data sizes the OpenCL overhead of starting up and getting all the data to the GPU, makes it a futile exercise.
It really starts to show promise at size around 800 and higher.
The speedup will continue rising towards an asymptote.
The start part will remain almost constant on modern systems, while the calculation part will only slowly become slower, thus out performing sequential CPU implementation by a large factor.

\end{figure}
\section{Task 2}
For the benchmark in \cref{fig:opencl-localsize-sweep} we used 5040, a highly composite number, as the data size.
This way we could try many local work group sizes with the same data size.
It seems that after a certain point, which seems to be around 16 to 18, the increase in local work group size does not improve the performance for this specific implementation.

\section{Task 3}
In \cref{lst:sse-matrix-snippet} our matrix OpenCL code is shown for both floats and doubles, a two dimensional globalSize is used to make sure it loops over both rows and columns.
